## ðŸ’¡ Final Project Idea #1

### Concept

This project is an interactive, gaze-powered experience set in a dark room. The core idea is that **your eyes act as a flashlight** -- illuminating different parts of the space as you explore with your gaze. As you look around, the room gradually reveals its environment, mood, and narrative through visuals and sound.

---

### Key Features

- **Gaze-Based Illumination**
  - The space begins in near-total darkness. As the user focuses on specific elements, light reveals them and triggers environmental changes.

- **Ambient Audio Feedback**
  - Looking at the **window**: lightning flickers and thunder rolls softly in the distance, setting a stormy night mood.
  - Looking at the **TV**: the screen powers on, showing flickering animations accompanied by background audio from a looping video.

- **Micro-Interactions**
  - Gaze at the **drawer**: it slowly opens.
  - Gaze at the **lamp**: it turns on and casts a soft glow around it.

## ðŸŒ· Final Project Idea #2

### Concept

This project presents an infinite, generative terrain -- a grassy landscape that evolves through gaze-based interaction. The user's gaze causes different elements to appear based on which part of the environment they are looking at. The goal is to create a calm, reactive ecosystem powered entirely by where the user looks.

---

### Key Features

- **Seed Blooming**
  - Looking at a **seed** causes it to grow and bloom into a flower.

- **Animal Interaction**
  - Looking at a **grassy area**: a **bunny** appears and begins hopping around the scene.

- **Sky Interaction**
  - Looking at the **sky**: a **bird** appears and flies through the air.

- **Procedural Terrain Generation**
  - The grassy landscape scrolls infinitely with new elements randomly placed as the user continues to look around.

- **Eye-Tracking Control**
  - The entire system is controlled by the user's gaze using eye-tracking, with no keyboard or mouse input required.

## ðŸŽ® Final Project Idea #3

### Concept

This project is an interactive game where the player launches a ball to hit falling letters that match a prompted word shown at the bottom. The goal is to hit each letter in order before time runs out.

---

### Key Features

- **Projectile Interaction**
  - Move the ball left/right and launch it upward to hit letters.

- **Feedback System**
  - Correct hit: increases the speed of falling letters.
  - Incorrect hit: decreases the speed of falling letters.

- **Score & Rounds**
  - Completing a word correctly: +1 to score.
  - Failing to complete a word (time runs out): score resets.
  - A new word is shown after each round.

---

### Storyboard

![correct hit of letter](assets/idea3_02.png)  
<sub>**Figure 9**: When the ball hits the correct letter, that letter is marked in the word and the falling speed increases.</sub>

<sub>**Figure 10**: When the ball hits the wrong letter, the falling speed decreases.</sub>

<sub>**Figure 12**: If time runs out before completing the word, a losing screen is shown.</sub>
